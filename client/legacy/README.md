# Legacy client files

This folder archives deprecated client pages and components that are no longer part of the app build. They are kept for reference only and will not be maintained.

- MaquinariasPageOld.jsx â€” superseded by the refactored Equipos/Maquinarias pages and the shared list components. Removed from src to prevent build and lint errors caused by duplicated legacy code.

If you need anything from these files, copy snippets into the current codebase and adapt to modern components and hooks.
